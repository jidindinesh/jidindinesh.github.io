Hi, I'm Adam.
I'm passionate about machine learning, particularly machine reasoning and generative modelling.
I'm really into time-series, attention, external memory and VAEs.
* I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Oxford, where I'm working with [Ingmar Posner](http://ori.ox.ac.uk/mrg_people/ingmar-posner/) and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/).
* I interned at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/), where I worked with [Danilo J. Rezende](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=UGlyhFMAAAAJ&hl=en).
* I received an MSc in Computational Science & Engineering from the Technical University of Munich, where I worked on VAEs for [Arm Movement Prediction](http://brml.org/positions/master-thesis-arm-movement-prediction/) with [Patrick van der Smagt](http://brml.org/people/smagt/).

Along my studies, I worked at Bloomberg, Samsung and IBM on various machine learning projects.
I am always looking for exciting research and professional opportunities, so feel free to get in touch

In my free time I read lots of books, train calithenics, lift heavy weights and hike mountains.

Hey! How you doing?
This is Jidin, a self motivated CS undergrad making diligent progess in the field of Machine Learning. 
I find Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Computer Vision particularly interesting. 
I enjoy travelling and clicking pictures. üíñ
